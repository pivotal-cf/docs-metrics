This topic describes how to configure Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) Metrics for your PCF deployment. Operators can use these procedures to optimize PCF Metrics for high capacity, or reduce resource usage for smaller deployment sizes.

For more information about PCF Metrics components, see [PCF Metrics Product Architecture](./architecture.html).

##<a id='suggested-sizing'></a> Suggested Sizing Configurations by Deployment Size

Use the following table as a reference for default sizing configurations depending on the size of your PCF Deployment (and the number of apps you have deployed).

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: the values in the tables below do not account for additional load on MySQL from custom metrics. We recommend starting with the one of the following configurations and scaling up as necessary by following the steps in (Configuring the Metrics Datastore)[./sizing.html#metrics-datastore]</p>

####Small: Test Use ~100 Apps

##<a id='metrics-datastore'></a> Configuring the Metrics Datastore

PCF Metrics stores metrics in a single MySQL node. For PCF deployments with high app logs load, you can add memory and persistent disk to the MySQL server node.

###<a id='metrics-considerations'></a> Considerations for Scaling
While the default configurations outlined above are a good starting point for your MySQL server node, they do not take into account the additional load from custom metrics. Pivotal recommends evaluating performance over a period of time and scaling upwards as necessary. As long as persistent disk is scaled up, you will not lose any data from scaling.

###<a id='metrics-procedures'></a> Procedures for Scaling

After determining the amount of memory and persistent disk required for your MySQL server node, perform the following steps:

1. Navigate to the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard and click the **Metrics** tile.
1. From the **Settings** tab of the **Metrics** tile, click **Resource Config**.
1. Modify the memory limit or persistent disk allocation as needed for your environment.

	<p class="note warning"><strong>WARNING:</strong> There have been issues with Ops Manager BOSH Director using persistent disks larger than 2TB.</p>

##<a id='log-datastore'></a> Configuring the Log Datastore

PCF Metrics uses Elasticsearch to store logs. Each Elasticsearch node contains multiple shards of log data, divided by time slice.

###<a id='log-considerations'></a> Considerations for Scaling

The default configurations outlined above are a good starting point for your Elasticsearch Master and Data nodes. For more precision depending on your logs load, feel free to perform the following calculations.

First, you'll need to determine how many logs the apps in your deployment emit and the average size of each log. If your average log size is x, average log rate is r logs/hour, the persistent disk size of a single ES data node is y, and number of ES data nodes is n, then n = r * 336 * x / y. This is assuming the retention period for logs is 2 weeks (and there are 336 hours in 2 weeks), and that x and y have the same units. You can use this formula to scale n and y as you see fit. If you wish to achieve HA for logs, then double the number of ES data nodes.

###<a id='log-procedures'></a> Procedures for Scaling

<p class="note warning">
<strong>WARNING</strong>: If you modify the number of Elasticsearch instances,
               the Elasticsearch cluster temporarily enters an unhealthy period during which
               it does not ingest any new logs data, due to shard allocation.</p>

After determining the number of Elasticsearch nodes needed for your deployment, perform the following steps to scale your nodes:

1. Navigate to the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard and click the **Metrics** tile.
1. From the **Settings** tab of the **Metrics** tile, click **Resource Config**.
1. Locate the **ElasticSearchData** job and select the dropdown menu under **Instances** to change the number of instances.

1. Click **Save**.  

##<a id='temp-datastore'></a> Configuring the Temporary Datastore

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: PCF Metrics uses the temporary datastore only when upgrading from v1.3 or later.</p>

During Elasticsearch downtime, including upgrades, PCF Metrics stores logs from the Loggregator Firehose in a temporary Redis datastore. When the upgrade finishes, the the Elasticsearch logqueue restores data from the temporary datastore by placing it in Elasticsearch. See [PCF Metrics Product Architecture](./architecture.html) for more information. 

###<a id='temp-procedures'></a> Procedure for Scaling

This procedure describes how to size the temporary datastore for your system by calculating your requirements and setting the VM size in Ops Manager. 

#### Calculate Storage Requirements

Calculate the storage requirements of the temporary datastore using the table below as a guide:

<table>
	<tr>
		<th>Variable</th>
		<th>Estimate a value for the variable</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><code>AvgLogSize</code></td>
		<td>Collect a sample of logs from your apps and calculate the average size of a log file in KB. 
		<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: PCF apps run on <a href="https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/concepts/diego/diego-architecture.html">Diego</a> cells that do not emit individual logs greater than approximately 60 KB. See <a href="https://github.com/cloudfoundry/loggregator#log-message-size-constraints">Log Message Size Constraints.</a></p></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><code>LogsPerSec</code></td>
		<td>
			<ol>
				<li>
					Install the <a href="https://docs.pivotal.io/loggregator/cli-plugin.html">nozzle plugin</a> for the cf CLI if you do not already have it. 
				</li>
				<li>
					Run following command to estimate of the volume of <code>LogMessages</code> emitted from the Loggregator Firehose. Every 10 seconds, the command gives you the average number of log messages per second, averaged over the previous 10 seconds.
			<pre class="terminal">$ cf nozzle -filter LogMessage | pv -l -i10 -r >/dev/null
[50.5 /s]</pre>
				</li>
			</ol>
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><code>UpgradeTime</code></td>
		<td>Estimate how long your PCF Metrics upgrade will take. In tests in a large production environment, the upgrade takes 20â€“30 minutes.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><code>RedisRAM</code></td>
		<td>Find the value for <code>RedisRAM</code> using the following calculation:<br>
<code>RedisRAM = AvgLogSize * LogsPerSec * UpgradeTime * 60</code></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>
		<code>AdjustedRedisRAM</code>
		</td>
		<td>Because Redis only allows VMs to use <a href="https://docs.pivotal.io/redis/installing.html#service-plans">45% of their allocated RAM</a>, adjust the storage requirement as follows:<br><code>AdjustedRedisRAM = RedisRAM / 0.45</code></td>
	</tr>
</table>

#### Set VM Size

Follow these steps to configure the size of the Redis VM for the temporary datastore based on your calculations.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: In the case that the temporary datastore becomes full, Redis uses the <code>volatile-ttl</code> eviction policy to continue storing incoming logs. For more information, see the <i>Eviction policies</i> section of <a href="https://redis.io/topics/lru-cache">Using Redis as an LRU cache</a>.</p>

1. Navigate to the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard and click the **Redis** tile.

1. From the **Settings** tab, click **Resource Config**. 

1. In the **Dedicated Node** row, under **VM Type**, select an option with at least enough **ram** to support the value for <code>AdjustedRedisRAM</code>. 

1. Click **Save**. 


##<a id='ingestor'></a> Configuring the Ingestor

PCF Metrics deploys the Ingestor as an app within PCF. The Ingestor consumes logs and metrics from the Loggregator Firehose, sending metrics and logs to their respective Logqueue apps. To customize PCF Metrics for high capacity, you can scale the number of Ingestor app instances and increase the amount of memory per instance.

###<a id='ingestor-considerations'></a> Considerations for Scaling

Because apps emit logs at different volumes and frequencies, you should not scale the Ingestor by matching the number of Ingestor instances to the number of app instances in your deployment.

Because Ingestor performance is affected by Loggregator performance, it can be difficult to determine in advance the proper configuration. Because of the ease in scaling these components, we recommend starting with a minimal configuration then evaluating performance over a period of time and scaling 

The Ingestor app can handle relatively large loads. For high availability, you must have at least two instances of the Ingestor app running. If your deployment runs fewer than 2000 app instances, two instances of the Ingestor app are sufficient. 

###<a id='ingestor-procedures'></a> Procedures for Scaling

<p class="note warning"><strong>WARNING: </strong> If you decrease the number of Ingestor instances, you might lose data currently being processed on the instances you eliminate.</p>

After determining the number of Ingestor app instances needed for your deployment, perform the following steps to scale the Ingestor:

1. Target your Cloud Controller with the Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface (cf CLI). If you have not installed the cf CLI, see [Installing the cf CLI](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/cf-cli/install-go-cli.html).
	<pre class="terminal">
	$ cf api api.YOUR-SYSTEM-DOMAIN
	Setting api endpoint to api.YOUR-SYSTEM-DOMAIN...
	OK
	API endpoint:   <span>https:</span>//api.YOUR-SYSTEM-DOMAIN (API version: 2.54.0)
	Not logged in. Use 'cf login' to log in.
	</pre>

1. Log in with your UAA administrator credentials. To retrieve these credentials, navigate to the **Pivotal Elastic Runtime** tile in the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard and click **Credentials**. Under **UAA**, click **Link to Credential** next to **Admin Credentials** and record the password.
	<pre class="terminal">
	$ cf login
	API endpoint: <span>https:</span>//api.YOUR-SYSTEM-DOMAIN

	Email> admin
	Password>
	Authenticating...
	OK

1. When prompted, target the `metrics` space.
	<pre class="terminal">
	Targeted org system

	Select a space (or press enter to skip):
	<span>1</span>. system
	<span>2</span>. notifications-with-ui
	<span>3</span>. autoscaling
	<span>4</span>. metrics

	Space> 4
	Targeted space metrics

	API endpoint:   <span>https:</span>//api.YOUR-SYSTEM-DOMAIN (API version: 2.54.0)
	User:           admin
	Org:            system
	Space:          metrics
	</pre>

1. Scale your Ingestor app to the desired number of instances:
	<pre class="terminal">$ cf scale metrics-ingestor -i INSTANCE-NUMBER</pre>
1. Evaluate the CPU and memory load on your Ingestor instances:
	<pre class="terminal">
	$ cf app metrics-ingestor
	Showing health and status for app metrics-ingestor in org system / space metrics as admin...
	OK
	<br>
	requested state: started
	instances: 1/1
	usage: 1G x 1 instances
	urls: 
	last uploaded: Sat Apr 23 16:11:29 UTC 2016
	stack: cflinuxfs2
	buildpack: binary_buildpack 
	<br>	
	     state     since                    cpu    memory        disk           details
	<span>#</span>0   running   2016-07-21 03:49:58 PM   2.9%   13.5M of 1G   12.9M of 1G
	</pre>

	If your average memory usage exceeds 50% or your CPU consistently averages over 85%, add more instances with `cf scale metrics-ingestor -i INSTANCE-NUMBER`.
	<br><br>
	In general, you should scale the Ingestor app by adding additional instances. However, you can also scale the Ingestor app by increasing the amount of memory per instance:

	<pre class="terminal">$ cf scale metrics-ingestor -m NEW-MEMORY-LIMIT</pre>

	For more information about scaling app instances, see [Scaling an Application Using cf scale](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/devguide/deploy-apps/cf-scale.html).

##<a id='logqueue'></a> Configuring the Logqueues

PCF Metrics deploys a MySQL Logqueue and an Elasticsearch Logqueue as apps within PCF. The MySQL logqueue consumes metrics from the Ingestor and forwards them to MySQL. The Elasticsearch logqueue consumes logs from the Ingestor and forwards them to Elasticsearch. To customize PCF Metrics for high capacity, you can scale the number of Logqueue app instances and increase the amount of memory per instance.

###<a id='logqueue-considerations'></a> Considerations for Scaling

The number of MySQL and Elasticsearch logqueues needed is dependent on the frequency of logs and metrics being forwarded by the Ingestor. As a general rule, for every 45,000 logs per minute, add 2 Elasticsearch logqueues. For every 17,000 metrics per minute, add 1 MySQL Logqueue. This is a general estimate and you might need fewer instances depending on your deployment. To optimize resource allocation, provision fewer instances initially and increase instances until you achieve desired performance.

###<a id='logqueue-procedures'></a> Procedures for Scaling

To modify your Elasticsearch Logqueue app instances, you must first target your Cloud Controller, log in with your UAA administrator credentials, and target the `metrics` space by following steps 1-3 in the [previous section](#ingestor-procedures).

To scale your Logqueue app instances, perform the following command:
<pre class="terminal">$ cf scale elasticsearch-logqueue -i INSTANCE-NUMBER</pre>

To scale the memory limit per Logqueue app instance, perform the following command:
<pre class="terminal">$ cf scale elasticsearch-logqueue -m NEW-MEMORY-LIMIT</pre>

To modify your MySQL Logqueue app instances, you must first target your Cloud Controller, log in with your UAA administrator credentials, and target the `metrics` space by following steps 1-3 in the [previous section](#ingestor-procedures).

To scale your Logqueue app instances, perform the following command:
<pre class="terminal">$ cf scale mysql-logqueue -i INSTANCE-NUMBER</pre>

To scale the memory limit per Logqueue app instance, perform the following command:
<pre class="terminal">$ cf scale mysql-logqueue -m NEW-MEMORY-LIMIT</pre>

<p class="note warning">
<strong>WARNING: </strong> If you decrease the number of Logqueue instances, you might lose data currently being processed on the instances you eliminate.</p>
