THIS INFO SHOULD BE COVERED BY THE METRICS FORWARDING DOC
KEEPING TEMPORARILY FOR REFERENCE
This topic describes how app developers can emit custom metrics from their apps and 
view them in visualized form using Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) Metrics.
Before you can use custom metrics, you need to provision and bind an instance of the 
custom metrics service to your app.



Preq
- Forwarder tile from Scott.
- Install it.
- Then bind it to the app.

## <a id="provision-and-bind"></a>Provision and Bind with the cf CLI

As part of installation, the product is automatically registered with Pivotal Cloud Foundry 
Elastic Runtime (see [Lifecycle Errands](#lifecycle-errands)). 
After a successful installation, the custom metrics service is available to app developers in the Marketplace, 
through the web-based Developer Console or `cf marketplace`. 
App developers can then provision instances of the service and bind them to their apps:

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf create-service custom-metrics standard my-custom-metrics
$ cf bind-service my-app my-custom-metrics
$ cf restart my-app
</pre>

For more information about the use of services, see the [Services Overview](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/devguide/services/). 
<p class="note warning"><strong>WARNING!</strong> Binding might not be available during a tile upgrade.</p>
