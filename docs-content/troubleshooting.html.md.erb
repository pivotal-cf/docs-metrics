This topic describes how to resolve common issues experienced while operating or using Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) Metrics.

## <a id="deployment"></a> Errors during Deployment

The following sections describe errors that cause failure during a PCF Metrics tile and how to troubleshoot them. 

###<a id='smoke-test'></a> Smoke Test Errors

PCF Metrics runs a set of smoke tests during installation to confirm system health.
If the smoke tests discover any errors, you can find a summary of those errors at the end of the errand log output,
including detailed logs about where the failure occurred. 

The following tables describe common failures and how to resolve them.

##<a id='ui'></a> No Logs or Metrics in the UI

In some cases, the PCF Metrics UI might not display metrics and logs after successfully deploying.

Follow the steps in this section to help locate the app or component causing the problem. 

### <a name="check-lb"></a> Step 1: Check your Load Balancer Configuration

If you use a load balancer, the event-stream mechanism used by the Metrics UI might be blocked. See the table below to resolve this error. 

If you do not use a load balancer, or this issue does not apply to your deployment, proceed to [Step 2: Check the PCF Metrics Apps](#check-apps).

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Error</th>
    <td>In the case of a customer using an F5 load balancer, metrics and logs were not visible in the UI despite successful ingestion and no UI errors reported.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Cause</th>
    <td>The root of the issue was the traffic of type text/event-stream was blocked by the F5 load balancer.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Solution</th>
    <td>When F5 was configured to allow event-stream traffic, the issue was resolved.
</td>
  </tr>
</table>
  
### <a name="check-apps"></a> Step 2: Check the PCF Metrics Apps

1. From Ops Manager, click the Elastic Runtime Tile. 
  1. Click the **Credentials** tab.
  1. Under the **UAA** job, next to **Admin Credentials**, click **Link to Credential**. 
  1. Record the username and password for use in the next step. 

1. Log in to the Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface (cf CLI) using the credentials from the previous step. 
  <pre class="terminal">$ cf login -a http<span>s</span>://api.YOUR-SYSTEM-DOMAIN -u admin -p PASSWORD</pre> 

1. When prompted, select the `system` org and the `metrics-v1-4` space. 

1. Ensure that the output displays the following apps, each in a `started` state:
  * `metrics-ingestor`
  * `mysql-logqueue`
  * `elasticsearch-logqueue`
  * `metrics-aggregator`
  * `metrics`
  * `metrics-ui`

1. Check the logs of each app for errors using the following command:
  <pre class="terminal">$ cf logs APP-NAME --recent</pre>
  If you do not see any output, or if you did not find any errors, proceed to [Step 3: Check the Elasticsearch Cluster](#check-es-cluster).

### <a name="check-es-cluster"></a>Step 3: Check the Elasticsearch Cluster

1. From Ops Manager, select the PCF Metrics tile. 

1. Under the **Status** tab, record the IP of an **Elasticsearch Master** node.  

1. Use `bosh ssh` to access the VM from the previous step.
For instructions, see [Advanced Troubleshooting with the BOSH CLI](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/customizing/trouble-advanced.html#prepare).

1. Run the following command to list all the Elasticsearch indices:
  <pre class="terminal">$ curl localhost:9200/\_cat/indices?v | sort
  <br> 
  green  open   app\_logs\_1477512000   8   1  125459066            0     59.6gb         29.8gb
  green  open   app\_logs\_1477526400   8   1  129356671            0     59.1gb         29.5gb
  green  open   app\_logs\_1478174400   8   1  129747170            0     61.9gb         30.9gb
  . . .
  green  open   app\_logs\_1478707200   8   1  128392686            0     63.2gb         31.6gb
  green  open   app\_logs\_1478721600   8   1  102005754            0     53.5gb         26.5gb
  health status index               pri rep docs.count docs.deleted store.size pri.store.size
  </pre>
  1. If the curl does not return a `success` response, Elasticsearch might not even be running correctly. Inspect the following logs for any failures or errors:
      * `/var/vcap/sys/logs/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.stdout.log`
      * `/var/vcap/sys/logs/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.stderr.log`

1. Examine the `status` column of the output.
  1. If the status of any of the indices is not `green`, restart the Logqueue app:
    <pre class="terminal">$ cf restart elasticsearch-logqueue</pre>
  1. Run the curl command periodically to see if the indices recover to a `green` status.

1. Run the curl command several more times and examine the most recent index to see if the number of stored documents periodically increases.
  <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: The last row of the output corresponds to the most recent index.
     The sixth column displays the number of documents for the index.</p>
  1. If all indices show a `green` status, but the number of documents does not increase,
     there is likely a problem further up in ingestion.
     Proceed to to [Step 4: Check the Elasticsearch Logqueue](#check-es-logqueue).


### <a name="check-es-logqueue"></a>Step 4: Check the Elasticsearch Logqueue

1. Run <code>cf apps</code> to see if the <code>elasticsearch-logqueue</code> app instances are `started`.

1. If any instance of the app is `stopped`, run the following command to increase logging:
  <pre class="terminal">$ cf set-env elasticsearch-logqueue LOG_LEVEL DEBUG</pre>
  1. Run the following command to stream logs:
  <pre class="terminal">$ cf logs elasticsearch-logqueue</pre>
  1. In a different terminal window, run the following command:
  <pre class="terminal">$ cf restage elasticsearch-logqueue</pre>
  1. Watch the logs emitted by the `elasticsearch-logqueue` app for errors. 
      * A common error is that the app cannot connect to Elasticsearch 
        because a user deleted the application security group (ASG) 
        that PCF Metrics creates to allow the Logqueue app to connect to the Elasticsearch VMs.
        You can run `cf security-group metrics-api` to see if the ASG exists. 
        If not, see [Creating Application Security Groups](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/adminguide/app-sec-groups.html).


1. If the app is started and you do not find any errors, proceed to [Step 5: Check the Metrics Ingestor](#check-ingestor).

### <a name="check-ingestor"></a>Step 5: Check the Metrics Ingestor

1. Run <code>cf apps</code> to see if the `metrics-ingestor` app instances are `started`. 
1. If any of the app instances are `stopped`, run the following command to increase logging:
  <pre class="terminal">$ cf set-env metrics-ingestor LOG_LEVEL DEBUG</pre>
  1. Run the following command to stream logs:
  <pre class="terminal">$ cf logs metrics-ingestor</pre>
  1. In a different terminal window, run the following command:
  <pre class="terminal">$ cf restage metrics-ingestor</pre>
  1. Watch the logs emitted by the `metrics-ingestor` app for errors. See the list below for common errors:
      * **Cannot connect to the firehose**: PCF Metrics creates a UAA user to authenticate the connection to the Firehose.
          This user must have the `doppler.firehose` authority.
      * **Cannot connect to the logqueues**: There might be a problem with the UAA, or it could be throttling traffic.
      * **WebSocket Disconnects**: If you see Websocket disconnects logs in the Ingestor app, consider adding additional Ingestor instances.
          The Firehose might be dropping the Ingestor connection to avoid back pressure.

1. If the app is started and you do not find any errors, proceed to [Step 6: Check MySQL](#check-mysql).

### <a name="check-mysql"></a>Step 6: Check MySQL

1. From Ops Manager, select the PCF Metrics tile. 

1. Under the **Status** tab, record the IP of a **MySQL Server** node.  

1. Use `bosh ssh` to access the VM from the previous step.
   For instructions, see [Advanced Troubleshooting with the BOSH CLI](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/customizing/trouble-advanced.html#prepare).

1. Log in to mysql by running `mysql -u USERNAME -p PASSWORD` 
  <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: If you do not know the username and password,
    you can run `cf env mysql-logqueue` with the <code>system</code> org and the <code>metrics-v1-4</code> space targeted.</p>

1. Verify that the database was bootstrapped correctly:
  1. Run `show databases` and check for a `metrics` database.
      1. If there is no `metrics` database, the `migrate_db` errand of the BOSH release might not have run or succeeded.
         Ensure the errand is selected in the tile configuration and update the tile.

1. Run `show tables` and ensure you see the following tables:
    
    ![Tables in Metrics](metrics-tables.png)

1. Enter the following query several times to verify that the value returned does not decrease over time:
  <pre class="terminal">mysql> select count(*) from metrics.app\_metric\_rollup where timestamp > ((UNIX\_TIMESTAMP() - 60) * POW(10, 3));</pre>
  This command displays the rate at which metrics flow in over the last minute.
      1. If the command returns `0` or a consistently decreasing value, the problem is likely further up in ingestion.
         Proceed to [Step 7: Check the MySQL Logqueue](#check-mysql-logqueue). 

### <a name="check-mysql-logqueue"></a> Step 7: Check the MySQL Logqueue

1. Run <code>cf apps</code> to see if the <code>mysql-logqueue</code> app instances are `started`.

1. If any instance of the app is `stopped`, run the following command to increase logging:
  <pre class="terminal">$ cf set-env mysql-logqueue LOG_LEVEL DEBUG</pre>
  1. Run the following command to stream logs:
  <pre class="terminal">$ cf logs mysql-logqueue</pre>
  1. In a different terminal window, run the following command:
  <pre class="terminal">$ cf restage mysql-logqueue</pre>
  1. Watch the logs emitted by the `mysql-logqueue` app for errors. 
      * A common error is that the app cannot connect to MySQL
        because a user deleted the application security group (ASG)
        that PCF Metrics creates to allow the Logqueue app to connect to the MySQL VMs.
        You can run `cf security-group metrics-api` to see if the ASG exists.
        If not, see [Creating Application Security Groups](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/adminguide/app-sec-groups.html).

1. If the app is started and you do not find any errors, proceed to [Step 8: Check the Metrics Aggregator](#check-aggregator).

### <a name="check-aggregator"></a>Step 8: Check the Metrics Aggregator

1. Run <code>cf apps</code> to see if the <code>metrics-aggregator</code> app instances are `started`.

1. If any instance of the app is `stopped`, run the following command to increase logging:
  <pre class="terminal">$ cf set-env metrics-aggregator LOG_LEVEL DEBUG</pre>
  1. Run the following command to stream logs:
  <pre class="terminal">$ cf logs metrics-aggregator</pre>
  1. In a different terminal window, run the following command:
  <pre class="terminal">$ cf restage metrics-aggregator</pre>
  1. Watch the logs emitted by the `metrics-aggregator` app for errors. 
      * A common error is that the app cannot connect to MySQL
        because a user deleted the application security group (ASG)
        that PCF Metrics creates to allow the aggregator app to connect to the MySQL VMs.
        You can run `cf security-group metrics-api` to see if the ASG exists.
        If not, see [Creating Application Security Groups](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/adminguide/app-sec-groups.html).

##<a id='mysql'></a> MySQL Node Failure

In some cases, a MySQL server node might fail to restart.
The following two sections describe the known conditions that cause this failure as well as steps for diagnosing and resolving them.
If neither of the causes listed apply, the final section provides instructions for re-deploying BOSH as a last resort to resolve the issue. 

### Cause 1: Monit Timed Out

#### Diagnose

Follow these steps to see if a `monit` time-out caused the MySQL node restart to fail:

1. Use `bosh ssh` to access the failing node, using the IP address in the Ops Manager Director tile **Status** tab. 
   For instructions, see [Advanced Troubleshooting with the BOSH CLI](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/customizing/trouble-advanced.html#prepare).
1. Run `monit summary` and check the status of the `mariadb_ctrl` job. 
1. If the status of the `mariadb_ctrl` job is `Execution Failed`, open the following file: `/var/vcap/sys/log/mysql/mariadb_ctrl.combined.log`. 
  1. If the last line of the log indicates that MySQL started without issue, such as in the example below,
     `monit` likely timed out while waiting for the job to report healthy. Follow the steps below to resolve the issue.
  <pre class="terminal">
  {"timestamp":"1481149250.288255692","source":"/var/vcap/packages/<br>mariadb\_ctrl/bin/mariadb\_ctrl","message":"/var/vcap/packages/<br>mariadb\_ctrl/bin/mariadb\_ctrl.mariadb\_ctrl<br> started","log\_level":1,"data":{}}
  </pre>

#### Resolve

Run the following commands to return the `mariadb_ctrl` job to a healthy state:

1. Run `monit unmonitor mariadb`.
1. Run `monit monitor mariadb`.
3. Run `monit summary` and confirm that the output lists `mariadb_ctrl` as `running`. 

### Cause 2: Bin Logs Filled up the Disk

#### Diagnose

1. Use `bosh ssh` to access the failing node.
   For instructions, see [Advanced Troubleshooting with the BOSH CLI](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/customizing/trouble-advanced.html#prepare). 
1. Open the following log file: `/var/vcap/sys/log/mysql/mysql.err.log`.
1. If you see log messages that indicate insufficient disk space, the [persistent disk](https://bosh.io/docs/persistent-disks.html) is likely storing too many bin logs.
   Confirm insufficient disk space by doing the following:
  1. Run `df -h`. 
      1. Ensure that you see the `/var/vcap/store` folder is at or over `90%` usage.
  1. Navigate to `/var/vcap/store/mysql` and run `ls -al`. 
      1. Ensure that you see many files named with the format `mysql-bin.########`.

In MySQL for PCF, the server node does not make use of these logs and you can remove all except the most recent bin log.
Follow the steps below to resolve the issue. 

#### Resolve

1. Log in to mysql by running `mysql -u USERNAME -p PASSWORD` 
  <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: If you do not know the username and password, you can run `cf env mysql-logqueue` with the <code>system</code> org and the <code>metrics-v1-4</code> space targeted.</p>
1. Run `use metrics;`.
1. Run the following command:
<pre class="terminal">mysql> PURGE BINARY LOGS BEFORE 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS'; </pre>

### Re-deploy BOSH to Restart the Node

If troubleshooting based on the causes mentioned above did not resolve the issue with your failing MySQL node,
you can follow the steps below to recover it.
Pivotal recommends only using this procedure as a if there are no other potential solutions available. 

<p class="note warning">
<strong>WARNING! </strong>
This procedure is extremely costly in terms of time and network resources.
The cluster takes a significant amount of time to put the data replicated to the rest of the cluster back into the rebuilt node.
This procedure consumes considerable network bandwidth as potentially hundreds of gigabytes of data needs to transfer.
</p>

#### Stop the Ingestor App

1. From Ops Manager, click the Elastic Runtime Tile. 
  1. Click the **Credentials** tab.
  1. Under the **UAA** job, next to **Admin Credentials**, click **Link to Credential**. 
  1. Record the username and password for use in the next step. 
1. Log in to the cf CLI using the credentials from the previous step. 
  <pre class="terminal">$ cf login -a http<span>s</span>://api.YOUR-SYSTEM-DOMAIN -u admin -p PASSWORD</pre> 
1. Target the <code>system</code> org and <code>metrics-v1-4</code> space of your PCF deployment:
    <pre class="terminal">$ cf target -o system -s metrics-v1-4</pre>
1. Stop data flow into the Galera cluster:
    <pre class="terminal">$ cf stop metrics-ingestor</pre>

#### Edit Your Deployment Manifest

1. Follow the steps in [Log in to BOSH](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/customizing/trouble-advanced.html#log-in) in _Advanced Troubleshooting with the BOSH CLI_ to target and log in to your BOSH Director.
   The steps vary slightly depending on whether your PCF deployment uses internal authentication or an external user store.
1. Download the manifest of your PCF deployment: 
    <pre class="terminal">
    $ bosh download manifest YOUR-PCF-DEPLOYMENT YOUR-PCF-MANIFEST.yml
    </pre>
    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: You must know the name of your PCF deployment to download the manifest. To retrieve it, run <code>bosh deployments</code> 
    to list your deployments and locate the name of your PCF deployment.</p>
1. Open the manifest and set the number of instances of the failed server node to `0`.
1. Run `bosh deployment YOUR-PCF-MANIFEST.yml` to specify your edited manifest.
1. Run `bosh deploy` to deploy with your manifest. 
1. Run `bosh disks --orphaned` to see the [persistent disk](https://bosh.io/docs/persistent-disks.html) or disks associated with the failed node.
  1. Record the `CID` of each persistent disk.
  1. Contact [Pivotal Support](http://support.pivotal.io/) to walk through re-attaching the orphaned disks to new VMs to preserve their data.
1. Open the manifest and set the number of instances of the failed server node to `1`.
1. Run `bosh deploy` to deploy with your edited manifest. 
1. Wait for BOSH to rebuild the node.
