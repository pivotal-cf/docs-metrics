This document describes how to install and configure Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) Metrics.

To use the custom metrics feature of the PCF Metrics tile, you must have the Metrics Forwarder tile.
However, the PCF Metrics tile can be installed without the Metrics Forwarder tile. 

For information about the components deployed as part of this install procedure,
see [PCF Metrics Product Architecture](./architecture.html).

## <a id='step1'></a> Add the PCF Metrics Tile to Ops Manager

1. Download the PCF Metrics file from
   [Pivotal Network](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pcf-metrics).
1. Upload the PCF Metrics file to your Ops Manager installation.
1. Click  **Add** next to the uploaded product description in the **Available Products**
   view to add PCF Metrics to your **Installation Dashboard**.

## <a id='step2'></a>Configure the PCF Metrics Tile

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: The following procedures offer a standard configuration.
              To customize PCF Metrics for high capacity,
              see the <a href="sizing.html">Sizing PCF Metrics for Your System</a>.</p>

1. From the **Installation Dashboard**, click the **PCF Metrics** tile.

2. Follow the procedures below to configure the PCF Metrics tile:
  + [Assign Availability Zones (AZs) and Networks](#az)
  + [Configure Metrics Components](#mc-config)
  + [Configure Errands](#errands)
  + [Configure Resources](#resource-config)
  + [Import Stemcell](#stemcell)

### <a id='az'></a> Assign Availability Zones (AZs) and Networks

1. Click **Assign AZs and Networks**.
1. Select an Availability Zone under **Place singleton jobs**.
   <br>
   Ops Manager runs Metrics jobs with a single instance in this Availability Zone.
1. Select one or more Availability Zones under **Balance other jobs**.
   <br>
   Ops Manager balances instances of Metrics jobs with more than one instance
   across the Availability Zones that you specify.
1. Use the drop-down menu to select a network.
   <br>
   PCF Metrics should be installed on the same network as the Elastic Runtime tile uses.
   However, if you do select a different subnet network, then refer to the table below when you configure
   the subnet network in the Elastic Runtime tile to make sure that you have
   the ports needed for each of the PCF Metrics data services.
   
    <table border="1" class="nice">
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Service</th>
          <th>Port</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>Elasticsearch</td>
          <td>9200</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>MySQL</td>
          <td>3306</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Redis</td>
          <td>6379</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    
1. Click **Save**.

### <a id="mc-config"></a> Configure Metrics Components

1. Click **Metrics Components Config**.
1. Review the **MySQL Logqueue Count** value.
   You can increase this instance count at any time to accommodate higher levels of inbound metrics traffic. 
1. Review the **Elasticsearch Logqueue Count** value.
   You can increase this instance count at any time to accommodate higher levels of inbound log traffic. 
1. Review the **Ingestor Count** value.
   You can increase this instance count at any time to accommodate higher levels of Loggregator Firehose traffic. 
1. Review the **Metrics API server instance count** value.
   You can increase this instance count at any time to accommodate deployments with more apps, metrics, and logs.
1. Click **Save**.

### <a id="errands"></a> Configure Errands

To properly configure the **Errands** pane, follow the procedure that corresponds to your Ops Manager version. 

+ [Configure Errands for Ops Manager v1.9](#19)
+ [Configure Errands for Ops Manager v1.10](#110)

#### <a name='19'></a> Configure Errands for Ops Manager v1.9

1. Click **Errands**.
  <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> The PCF Metrics tile selects all <strong>Post-Deploy Errands</strong> by default.
     Pivotal recommends that you do not deselect any errands as doing so can cause issues with the deployment of the tile.
     However, you can deselect the <b>Remove PCF Metrics 1.3 CF Resources Errand</b> and
     <strong>Migrate Old Data to 1.4 Errand</strong> after deploying v1.4 of the tile.</p>
1. Review the **Post-Deploy Errands** and **Pre-Delete Errands**:
  If you are deploying the tile for the first time, select all **Post-Deploy Errands**.<br>
     The following list describes what the **Smoke Tests** errand does.
     See [Smoke Test Errors](./troubleshooting.html#smoke-test) in _Troubleshooting PCF Metrics_
     for information on resolving errors discovered by this errand:
  * Confirms that MySQL ingests metrics
  * Confirms that Elasticsearch ingests logs
  * Confirms that the Metrics API returns metrics and logs
  * Confirms that any custom metrics coming out of the Firehose are ingested and stored

        <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: If you deselect <strong>Remove PCF Metrics 1.4 CF Resources Errand</strong>
           under <strong>Pre-Delete Errands</strong>, artifacts might remain after the PCF Metrics tile uninstalls.</p>

#### <a id='110'></a> Configure Errands for Ops Manager v1.10

1. Click **Errands**.

1. Review the **Post-Deploy Errands** and **Pre-Delete Errands**:
  1. If you are deploying the tile for the first time, set all **Post-Deploy Errands** to **On**.
  1. For deployments after the initial install, configure the **Post-Deploy Errands** as follows:
      1. Set **Remove PCF Metrics 1.3 CF Resources Errand** to **When Changed**
      1. Set **Push PCF Metrics components Errand** to **On**
      1. Set **Migrate Old Data to 1.4 Errand** to **When Changed**
      1. Set **Smoke Tests Errand** to **On**<br>
         The following list describes what the **Smoke tests** errand does.
         See [Smoke Test Errors](./troubleshooting.html#smoke-test) in _Troubleshooting PCF Metrics_ for information on resolving errors discovered by this errand:
          * Confirms that MySQL ingests metrics
          * Confirms that Elasticsearch ingests logs
          * Confirms that the Metrics API returns metrics and logs
          * Confirms that any custom metrics coming out of the Firehose are ingested and stored
    
        <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: If you set <strong>Remove PCF Metrics 1.4 CF Resources</strong> 
           under <strong>Pre-Delete Errands</strong> to <strong>Off</strong>,
           artifacts might remain after the PCF Metrics tile uninstalls.</p>

### <a id="resource-config"></a> Configure Resources

1. Click **Resource Config**.
1. Review the resource configurations. By default, the settings match the instance types that are best suited for each job.
   For reference, the following table shows the default resource and IP requirements for installing the PCF Metrics tile:
  <table border="1" class="nice">
    <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Resource</th>
      <th>Instances</th>
      <th>Persistent</th>
      <th>CPU</th>
      <th>RAM</th>
      <th>Ephemeral</th>
      <th>Static IP</th>
      <th>Dynamic IP</th>
    </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>

      <td>500&nbsp;GB</td>
      <td>4</td>
      <td>4&nbsp;GB</td>
      <td>8&nbsp;GB</td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>0</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>MySQL Server</td>
      <td>1 (Not configurable)</td>
      <td>500&nbsp;GB</td>

  </table> 
    If you expect a high level of use, you might need to increase the disk resources available to your instances. 
    For more information, see [Sizing PCF Metrics for Your System](./sizing.html).
  
    <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> For Ops Manager v1.9, if you configure a job with persistent disk larger than 2&nbsp;TB,
       you might experience disk partitioning issues with the BOSH Director.</p>

1. Click **Save**.

### <a id="stemcell"></a> Import Stemcell

1. Navigate to [Pivotal Network](https://network.pivotal.io) and click **Stemcells**.
1. Download the appropriate stemcell version for your IaaS.
   <p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong> On AWS, make sure to use a HVM stemcell if you are using the default instance sizes.</p>
1. Click **Import Stemcell** and select the stemcell file you downloaded.

## <a id='step3'></a>Deploy PCF Metrics

1. Click **Apply Changes** to install the service.
