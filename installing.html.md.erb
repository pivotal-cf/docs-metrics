This document describes how to install and configure Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) Metrics.

For information about the components deployed as part of this install procedure, see the [PCF Metrics Product Architecture](./architecture.html) topic.

## <a id='pre-reqs'></a>Prerequisites

* Ensure that you have installed the [Elastic Runtime Tile](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/installing/index.html).
* Ensure that you have installed v1.6 or later of the [Redis tile](https://docs.pivotal.io/redis/1-6/).
* If you are running PCF on AWS, then ensure that, in Elastic Runtime, you have changed the <strong>Loggregator Port</strong> to `4443`from its value of `443`.
* If you are running PCF on Google Cloud Platform (GCP), then do the following to configure the DNS entries to 
accommodate web sockets:
   1. Log in to the GCP console.
   2. In the menu, navigate to the **Networking** tab and click **Load Balancing**.
   3. Find the load balancer that corresponds to `ENVIRONMENT-cf-ws`.
   4. Record the IP address.
   5. Click **Cloud DNS**, then click **ENVIRONMENT-zone**.
   6. Click **Add Record Set**.
   7. Enter a DNS name for mysql-logqueue. The DNS name should be `mysql-logqueue.SYSTEM_DOMAIN`.  Refer to your ERT Tile's configuration of the System Domain under the Domains configuration section.
   8. In the IPv4 address field, enter the IP address of the load balancer that you recorded in Step 4.
   9. Leave the other fields as default.
   10. Repeat Steps 6â€“9 twice to create DNS records for elasticsearch-logqueue (`elasticsearch-logqueue.SYSTEM_DOMAIN`) and metrics (`metrics.SYSTEM_DOMAIN`).
   
## <a id='step1'></a> Step 1: Add the PCF Metrics Tile to Ops Manager
   <p class='note'><strong>Note</strong>: PCF Metrics should be installed on the same network as the Elastic Runtime Tile. </p>

### <a name="errands"></a> Errands

To properly configure the **Errands** pane, follow the procedure that corresponds to your Ops Manager version. 

#### Ops Manager 1.9

1. Click **Errands**.
  <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> The PCF Metrics tile selects all <strong>Post-Deploy Errands</strong> by default. Pivotal recommends that you do not deselect any errands as doing so can cause issues with the deployment of the tile. However, you can deselect the <b>Remove Legacy PCF Metrics CF Resources</b> errand after deploying v1.3 of the tile.</p>
1. Review the **Post-Deploy Errands** and **Pre-Delete Errands**:
  1. If you are deploying the tile for the first time, select all **Post-Deploy Errands**.
      * The following list describes what the **Smoke tests** errand does. For information about resolving errors discovered by this errand, 
        see the [Smoke Test Errors](./troubleshooting.html#smoke-test) section of the _Troubleshooting PCF Metrics_ topic.
          * Confirms that MySQL ingests metrics
